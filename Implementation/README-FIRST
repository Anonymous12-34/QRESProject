1. On Tomcat default install, edit META-INF/context.xml to allow connections only from localhost:
           <Context>
                 <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
                allow="0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1,127\.0\.0\.1" />
       </Context>

2. On Tor default install, edit torrc file to provide access to your local service through the Tor network, for example:
      HiddenServiceDir /Library/Tor/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
      HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:8080
     Get the address stored on the hidden_service, lets say "7ludtxdcobw5l2ut.onion"

3. Open Project from the Netbeans by giving the location of CloudEncryption (the source file).

4. Create an account on amazonaws and create 2 tables in amazon dynamodb. One for storing the encrypted tokens and the other for saving
the tokens matching the keywords.

5. Open Tor browser and type 
  7ludtxdcobw5l2ut.onion/CloudEncryption/message.jsp
**Write the required token (by this you already sent an encrypted token as shown in figure encrypted token).**

6. Open Tor browser and type.
7ludtxdcobw5l2ut.onion/CloudEncryption/ keyword.jsp
***Run the keyword.jsp file and find search keyword (your keyword is encrypted and in process of searching for the matching token)***

7. You can check AWS dynamoDB tables for update by amazon aws login.
