# QRESProject

**Formal specification foder** contains all the Proverif scripts used to prove the properties defined in the paper.

**Implementation** contains the source code of QRES and a document detailing the steps/sources needed to evaluate the QRES system. 

Furthermore, the implementation folder contains screen shots of (a) the encryption and transfer of tokens by the CSP (encrypted tokens are then saved in mongoDB), (b) encryption of each keyword (using garbled circuit) and then searching for each keyword over the encrypted tokens by the broker, and finally (c) saved tokens on the dynamoDB. We also show the Tor established circuit used.
